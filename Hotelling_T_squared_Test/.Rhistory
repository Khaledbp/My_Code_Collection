# This program performs a Hoteling two sample T-square test for
# the equality of two population mean vectors assuming a common
# covariance matrix.
# It also gives the Garthwaite-Koch partition which evaluates
# the contibutions of individual variables to the test statistic,
# both as the actual value and a percentage.
# The program requires two data matrices as input, one for each sample.
# The next few lines must be modified to give the addresses of the two input
# files (.txt files) that contain the data.
# Each file should have a header line naming the variables. Names must differ
# in the two files (e.g a variable might be called "weight" in one file and
# "weight2" in the other.) A name must not include spaces. Each subsequent
# line gives the values of the variables for one datum, separated by spaces.
