The R code to implement the ADA prioritization method       Example file: ADAfile

In R, the code to implement this function is:


source("ADAprioritized.r")
ADATest('ADAfile.txt', 0.05, 1000, 1, 'additive', TRUE)        # wait for ~3 seconds 


where 'ADAfile.txt' is the data file, in which the first column is the disease status (1: case; 0: control), and column 2 to the last column are the numbers of minor alleles.

The following input elements of this function are:
mafThr = 0.05,           (Exclude SNPs with combined MAF > 0.05)
num_perm = 1000,    (the number of permutations)
midp = TRUE,             (mid P-values according to the Fisher's exact test)
mode = 'additive',      (mode of inheritance = "additive")
twoSided = TRUE        (two-sided test)

Output: The output contains three objects:
(1) pval: the P-value of the ADA test.
(2) optimal.t: the P-value threshold producing the minimum P-value for the unpermuted sample.
(3) posit: the variants with per-site P-values smaller than optimal.t. The final set of variants selected by the ADA prioritization method.
If posit returns 32 and 46, it means that No. 32 and No. 46 are important variants. That is, the variants saved as the 33rd and the 47th columns in ADAfile.txt are prioritized. Note that the first column in ADAfile.txt is the disease status.


Thanks for your interest.
