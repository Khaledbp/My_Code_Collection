HM_analysis.sas is the general code that performs the hierarchical modeling approach (see documentation for input and output files). To illustrate the implementation we invoke the macro using as higher level covariates Polyphen-2 and Gerp (PolyGerp_Syn0.txt) where synonymous variants were assigned a Polyphen-2 score of 0.
